    <p>As an eight-year-old, I was petrified to stand alone in the park especially when all my playmates had gone back home. The blanket of darkness had started to spread its wings over. I dreadfully awaited my grandpaâ€™s return who I could not see anywhere.</p>
    <p>I looked here and there, and I looked everywhere but could not see the tiniest ray of hope. All that I saw were strangers staring at me with astonishment. They looked confused as I stood crying on a small bridge in the center of the park.</p>
    <p>People saw me and kept moving and turned around to have a look again but never offered any help. I was by now sure that I would never reach home and that I had lost my grandpa forever.</p>
    <p>The sky kept growing darker and devilish. Soon my sobbing turned into loud cries. My cries were so loud that I was gasping for breath. Fear of the unknown had tightly gripped my heart turning into a cold sweat.</p>
    <p>But God bless that woman, who didnâ€™t just walk away. She stopped to comfort me and talk to me. I thought to myself,</p>
    <p>She also had children with her. One little girl of my age who stood beside her watching me closely. The other one, a boy, even younger than her sitting peacefully in the ladyâ€™s lap.</p>
    <p>My first reaction to receiving help should have been happiness. It was, indeed. But I didnâ€™t exactly express the way I should have. In fact, the moment the woman started talking, I cried even louder.</p>
    <p>If I had known the term â€˜larynxâ€™ then, I could have bet it would have popped right out from my mouth. Poor little thing.</p>
    <p>Anyway, after a lot of over-the-top-drama, I finally shared my story with her. I explained to her how my grandpa had promised to return in 5 minutes but has been away for hours now.</p>
    <p>The woman asked me all sorts of questions. If not for her commoner clothes, I would have easily mistaken her for an investigating officer. She was quite convincing. Of course, she was trying her best to help me out.</p>
    <img src="http://unsplash.it/400/400" class="align-left slide-in">
    <p>As my crying subsided, I started liking her. Though she was feeling very sympathetic towards me while her kids just stared on with their puppy eyes. She spent a couple of five minutes to calm me down. And boy! She did succeed</p>
    <img src="http://unsplash.it/400/400" class="align-right slide-in">
    <p>Finally, she held my hand and walked me towards the exit gate of the park. By this time I had laid all my faith in this lady. I knew it because I was not scared to walk with her at all. But, curious, yes. I was very curious to know what will unfold next.</p>
    <p>Once we reached the main road, she saw a police van stationed right outside the garden. She told me that we should approach them for help as I couldn't recollect my address properly due to fear.</p>
    <img src="http://unsplash.it/400/400" class="align-right slide-in">
    <p>She walked me towards the police van and asked them to help me get back home safely. One of the police uncles approached me in a very friendly way and asked, â€˜â€™Child, what is your full name, and with whom did you come to the park with?â€™â€™</p>
    <p>I had almost started to narrate my entire story again when the woman intervened and completed the story for me. It seems that she was more curious than I was.</p>
    <p>After some exchanging of sentences, they decided that I should go with the police officers. They would try to find out from their records about my whereabouts and get me back home. Made sense.</p>
    <p>The woman was a little reluctant but gave in. They were public servants after all. So she agreed to let me go with them. I could see she was emotional and still a little fearful. She assured me that I should not worry anymore as the officers would help me out. I agreed.</p>


    <p>So just when I was about to get into the police van, my grandpa appeared out of the blue. He by this time had no freaking idea of the drama that had unfolded behind his back. All this while he had been looking for me in the garden area where he had originally left me.</p>
    <p>But when he couldnâ€™t find me anywhere near that area, he decided to look somewhere else. Where should he look next? That was a big question. But the answer was quite simple.</p>
    <p>There was a huge crowd just outside the park in front of a police van. He thought letâ€™s go and check out there. Relieved as he was, to see me, his granddaughter safe and sound. His happiness knew no bounds.</p>
    <p>But his happiness bubble was instantly poked in by the same lady who had helped me calm down all this time. The sweet and caring woman transformed into some angry Indian Goddess. She conducted a standing court marshall for my grandfather.</p>
    <p>She took his class up and down, left and right. What I found amazing was that even the police kept quiet when the woman was talking. The more the woman shouted, the more I would smile. Not because I was enjoying it. But due to the fact that he had the audacity to leave me alone for such a prolonged period of time.</p>
    <p>Anyway, when the woman was done taking my grandpaâ€™s case the police finally spoke. They just asked me if the man was indeed my grandpa and I just looked at him while wiping off my happy tears and said â€˜â€™yesâ€™â€™ with a fainted smile of course.</p>
    <p>The crowd dispersed as quickly as it had gathered. My grandpa couldnâ€™t thank the lady enough for helping me in such a dire situation. The lady of course didnâ€™t accept his thankyouâ€™s and apologies. Instead gave him free advice to never take kids with him when he couldnâ€™t handle them.</p>
    <p>Well, what else could he say? He just gave an apologetic smile to her. He would have dared argue with her. He was just too happy to find me again. Just like me, he too had thought, heâ€™d lost me forever.</p>
    <p>With this happy ending, I bade goodbye and a special hug to that aunty who was great support for me. She proved true that she was indeed an angel. I t is very rare to see people helping others without any ulterior motives.</p>
    <p>Anyway, I and my grandfather caught a bus back home. As a punishment, grandpa bought me loads of toys to keep me entertained on the way back home.</p>
    <p>It has been 24 years since this incident but it still brings a huge grin on my face. That evening we had created a memory quite unique in itself. We both smiled whenever we recollected that story.</p>
    <p>It seemed funny because the story had a happy ending. It could have had a very bitter ending. But with Godâ€™s grace, we look at it as a very happy and cherishable memory. ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–</p>
    <p>This story is very close to my heart and will always be. I hope it brought a smile on your face too.</p>
